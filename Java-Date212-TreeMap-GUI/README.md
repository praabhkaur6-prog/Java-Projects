Enhanced the application by replacing manual sorting with Java’s TreeMap and adding robust input validation.

Used TreeMap<Date212, Object> for automatic sorting

Eliminated duplicate dates using map key behavior

Created custom IllegalDate212Exception

Validated input dates (format, month, day ranges)

Added a full GUI with File → Open and Quit menu options

Concepts:
Java Collections Framework, custom exceptions, defensive programming, GUI event handling, file I/O.
